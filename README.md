Created a Amazon Clone using HTML5 and CSS3
Creating a simple Amazon clone using HTML and CSS involves designing the basic structure and styling of a webpage to resemble the Amazon website. Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and a real e-commerce website would involve server-side scripting, a database, and more advanced functionality.

I have created this to learn about Html and Css for practice.
